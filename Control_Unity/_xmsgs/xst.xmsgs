<msg type="warning" file="Xst" num="737" delta="new" >Found <arg fmt="%d" index="1">6</arg>-bit latch for signal &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="2">CU_out</arg>&gt;. Latches may be generated from incomplete case or if statements. We do not recommend the use of latches in FPGA/CPLD designs, as they may lead to timing problems.

<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="2169" delta="new" >HDL ADVISOR - Some clock signals were not automatically buffered by XST with BUFG/BUFR resources. Please use the buffer_type constraint in order to insert these buffers to the clock signals to help prevent skew problems.
